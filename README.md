## üîó How to Join

1. Either make a new post in [üîó Join Requests](https://github.com/gchartier/html-energy-webring/discussions/categories/join-requests) or email me at [gchartier@pm.me](mailto:gchartier@pm.me) with:

-   Your website URL that you will have the webring widget on
-   1 thing you love most about the web

2. One of the maintainers will add your url to the webring.
3. Add the webring widget to your site by adding the following code to the webpage at the url you provided:

```html
<!-- Put the stylesheet in the head of your website -->
<head>
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://www.gabriel-export.earth/html-energy-webring/onionring/styles.css"
    />
</head>

<!-- Put the widget anywhere on your website -->
<div id="html-energy-webring">
    <script
        type="text/javascript"
        src="https://www.gabriel-export.earth/html-energy-webring/onionring/variables.js"
    ></script>
    <script
        type="text/javascript"
        src="https://www.gabriel-export.earth/html-energy-webring/onionring/widget.js"
    ></script>
    <!-- üî∫ Order matters here! üî∫ -->
</div>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In order for the webring navigation experience to work well, it's important that you add the webring widget to the **same webpage url** that you provided. If you add the widget to a different url than the one provided, it will still work, but when someone lands on your page, they will not be able to continue surfing the webring.

> [!TIP]  
> You are free to submit multiple sites if you'd like!

> [!NOTE]  
> The webring index and member list are not hosted from this repository, however this repository is kept up to date with the latest changes. The webring index and member list are hosted on [www.gabriel-export.earth/html-energy-webring/](https://www.gabriel-export.earth/html-energy-webring/).
